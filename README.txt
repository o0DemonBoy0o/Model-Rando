Use the provided pkgmap_extras.json and replace the existing one in your build_from_mm folder with it or hd textures may not look correct.

The "extras" folder is where model lists for non base game models go. if you want to disable any or all of the extra models then simply remove the model lists from the folder.
It's also possible to create your own extra packs to be used if desired.
